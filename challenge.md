# Challenge

To foster progress in link prediction on large-scale, heterogeneous biomedical data, we invite you to participate in the OpenBioLink Challenge. Link Prediction on knowledge graphs is a versatile paradigm for generating new insights about relationships between two entities. It is especially important in fields such as biomedical research, where it can help with hypothesis generation, prioritizing drug targets or therapeutic substances for experimental screening etc.
